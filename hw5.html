        <h1>The History of Basketball</h1>
        <p>
            Basketball was invented in December 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a physical education instructor 
            at the YMCA in Springfield, Massachusetts. The game was created to keep students active indoors 
            during the winter months. Naismith developed a set of 13 basic rules and hung a peach basket 
            at each end of the gymnasium. The objective was to throw a ball into the opposing team's basket.

            The first official game of basketball was played on January 20, 1892. The sport quickly gained 
            popularity, spreading to colleges and universities across the United States. By the early 20th 
            century, professional leagues began to emerge, leading to the formation of the National Basketball 
            Association (NBA) in 1946.
